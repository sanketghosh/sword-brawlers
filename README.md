# Sword Brawlers

---

**Sword Brawlers** is a 2D multiplayer, browser-based game.

## How to Play?

- Go to the site and create a new game by entering a random username.
- A new game ID will be generatedâ€”share this ID with a friend you want to play with.
- You will be redirected to the game space.
- Each player will have separate controls.
- The game will display your assigned key mappings.
- The first player to exhaust their health bar loses the game.

<!-- ### Additional Points:

- Add a brief explanation of the game mechanics (e.g., attacking, defending, and movement).
- Mention whether there are any power-ups or special moves.
- Clarify if there is a time limit or other win conditions. -->

## Tech Stack

- **Bun** as the runtime.
- **Vanilla TS** without any frontend framework
- **Kaplay.js**, a 2D game development framework.
- **Backend:** Built with **TypeScript** and a preferred backend language.
- **Express.js** as the backend framework.
- **Socket.io** for real-time multiplayer interactions.

## Future Work

- **Rewriting the entire UI** using a UI framework, preferably **React** (with TypeScript) or a React-based framework (**Next.js** or **TanStack Start**) for better code management and component-driven architecture. **Kaplay.js** will still be used.
- **Implementing a routing solution**, either **React Router DOM** or **TanStack Router**, for improved route management if no meta framework is used.
- **Enhancing the backend** with features like:
  - User registration and authentication.
  - Managing user game history.
  - Leaderboards or ranking systems.
- **Potential backend migration** to **Elixir**, as I want to learn Elixir and its frameworks. ðŸ˜†

<!-- ### Additional Points:

- Specify whether user authentication will be session-based or token-based (e.g., JWT).
- Mention if you're considering cloud hosting options for scalability.
- Detail plans for matchmaking or ranked modes if applicable.
